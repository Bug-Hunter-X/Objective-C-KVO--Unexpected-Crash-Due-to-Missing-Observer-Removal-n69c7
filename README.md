This repository demonstrates a common but easily missed error in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and memory management.  The `bug.m` file shows code that leads to a crash, while `bugSolution.m` provides the correct solution.  The crux of the problem lies in failing to remove the observer before the observed object is deallocated.  This results in an attempt to access already-released memory, leading to an EXC_BAD_ACCESS crash.
